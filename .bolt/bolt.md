Our conversation has revolved around the development of the "GrowEasy - Urban Garden App," a React Native Expo application. We've progressed through several key development tasks, focusing on the Quick-Actions Sheet feature.

Here's a summary of our journey so far:

Project Setup and Constraints: You provided a comprehensive overview of the project's architecture, including its use of Expo SDK 52.0.30 and Expo Router 4.0.17, with a primary focus on web platform compatibility. Key constraints include using StyleSheet.create for styling, adhering to the useFrameworkReady hook, preferring inline error handling, managing fonts with @expo-google-fonts, and utilizing specific libraries like react-native-reanimated and react-native-gesture-handler. We also established guidelines for navigation (tabs as primary), icon usage (Lucide), camera integration (expo-camera), API routes, and payment solutions (RevenueCat for subscriptions).

TASK-QUICK-001 – Skeleton & Navigation: We successfully implemented the foundational UI and navigation for the Quick-Actions Sheet. This included enabling swipe-left and long-press gestures on plant cards to open the sheet. Initial dependency and shell errors encountered during this phase were identified and resolved.

TASK-QUICK-002 – Integrate Mutations & Optimistic Updates: This task involved connecting the Quick-Actions Sheet to the application's core functionalities. We integrated real care mutations for water, fertilize, harvest, and archive actions using dedicated hooks (useLogWatering, useLogFertilizing, useLogHarvest, useArchivePlant). Key achievements included:

Implementing optimistic UI updates for immediate feedback, with a rollback mechanism in case of errors.
Displaying confetti animations and toast notifications upon successful actions.
Ensuring query invalidation for homeSnapshot and plant details to keep data consistent.
Managing loading states by disabling action buttons during mutations.
Handling errors gracefully by rolling back optimistic updates and showing toast messages.
Firing analytics events (quick_action_done, quick_action_archive) for tracking.
Updating unit and RTL tests to cover these new integrations and updating Storybook with relevant knobs.

TASK-QUICK-003 – Edge States & Tests: The most recent task focused on refining the Quick-Actions Sheet's robustness and user experience. We implemented:

A global loading overlay (LoadingOverlay) that appears when any mutation is in progress, preventing multiple taps.
An archive confirmation modal (using Alert for native platforms) to confirm the user's intent before archiving a plant.
A persistent error banner (ErrorBanner) that displays within the sheet after two consecutive failures of the same action, providing retry and dismiss options.
Enhanced accessibility by adding accessibilityRole and accessibilityLabel to action buttons, and ensuring focus management for the error banner.
Expanded unit and RTL tests to cover these new edge states, including success, single error, repeated errors leading to the banner, and archive confirmation flows, aiming for ≥80% coverage for the /quickActions directory.
Updated Storybook with controls to simulate global loading, error banner visibility, and archive confirmation.
In essence, we've built a robust and user-friendly Quick-Actions Sheet, complete with real-time data updates, comprehensive error handling, and strong test coverage.
